<h2 id="part-1-expectation-and-repetition">Part 1: Expectation and repetition</h2>
<p>So much of music is about expectation. People who make music set these up by working within and against what a listener is expecting, which is, in turn, based on shared experience. The result is a series of common practices or loose guidelines that are commonly called “rules.” Much of music’s excitement, confusion, surprise—the richness that makes it fulfilling in so many ways—derives from how it satisfies or transgresses our expectations.</p>
<p>This set of short essays describes core elements of rhythm by prioritizing perception with three goals in mind. First, I aim to introduce some terminology that can inform how we hear and understand what we listen to. These elements may prove more or less helpful depending on the music that is playing, but they are widely applicable.</p>
<p>Second, the approaches here resist the western-centric methods and perspectives that commonly define things like beat, meter, and subdivision. The examples that I present—especially the ones in the final section, where I draw from my own research in Morocco—show how western perspectives are not as widely useful as they are often assumed to be. Like other global musical systems, western musical notation is derived from specific histories and compositional styles. It is a tool serving a purpose, one that is usually related to the preservation of specific elements of a composition for the sake of performance. Even within the context of western classical music, it hinders certain nuances of performance practice when used inappropriately. For this reason, I define concepts broadly with the hope that they may prove more useful across a range of musics and experiences.</p>
<p>And, speaking of experience, I want to focus our understanding of music and sound more holistically on the body. We do not just hear music, we feel it, dance it, sing it, and hear to the world around us through it. Yet, each of us does so differently based on our own experiences, abilities, training, hopes, dreams, and so on.</p>
<p>These essays are organized into four parts. The first introduces some basic concepts of rhythm through the lens of expectation. The second addresses repetition and meter using cycles, again drawing on expectation. The third moves to the micro-level by discussing beat and timing and how they impact the way we feel music. The final part uses these ideas of rhythm, expectation, and repetition to introduce and analyze three rhythmic patterns from Moroccan sacred musics that resist easy definition according to western perspectives.</p>
<h3 id="familiarity-unfamiliarity-and-repetition">Familiarity, unfamiliarity, and repetition</h3>
<p>While rhythm is an integral part of all music, it is often foregrounded in discussions of drumming or percussion. Depending on your musical experiences and expectations—what you listen to—a drumming pattern can be confusing, boring, groovy, exciting, and so on. Here is a common rock beat. Thanks to the globalizing tendencies of the music industry, this is a familiar sound for many people across the world.</p>
<div id="example1" class="example">

</div>
<p>Many different things combine to determine how you might hear and feel this pattern. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>Familiarity:</strong> If you have heard certain types of popular music before, then this pattern may sound familiar. That does not mean that you have words to describe it or have ever listened and said “Oh, I know that drum pattern, I’ve heard it before!” This is an example of how things like globalization, memory, nostalgia, and culture play out in listening. If someone remembers her parents listening to a certain artist or type of music (like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjCoKslQOEs">1950s country</a>, the band <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5jNJd7HRVU">Blood, Sweat, and Tears</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyYqkRv0D5g">1980s hip hop</a>, for example), then similar little moments in something that is new to her can bring back old emotions or memories. For country, a guitar picking technique might trigger a memory. Brass instruments like the trumpet and trombone in a rock band might take her back to Blood, Sweat, and Tears. “Old school” beat samples may draw out ’80s hip hop. It is nearly impossible to talk about music without these memories and experiences. The hard part, of course, is that we all live different lives. Therefore, when we hear something new (or old), we hear it differently. Even if it’s a supposedly “simple” rock beat.</p>
<p><strong>Unfamiliarity:</strong> If you have no expectations—maybe because something you hear, see, or taste is brand new to you—it’s really hard to guess what is coming next. But we only have to wait a moment to find out. With visual art that is static (like a painting), we might take our time and look more closely at details. We return to what we saw and think about it differently. Music vanishes into the air as soon as we hear it. We are left with memories of the sound and of how our bodies reacted to it. Maybe we danced and felt the movement. Perhaps we are at a loud live concert where we were pushed around by the sound waves. I still remember the sensation of how the heavy drums at a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LhCd1W2V0Q">Lenny Kravitz</a> concert physically shoved my guts to the back of my ribcage when I was in high school.</p>
<p><strong>Repetition:</strong> If the sound repeats, then it is easier to find a pattern and build an expectation. Of course, it also sets us up as listeners to be surprised when the repetition ends. And some patterns show themselves to us more quickly: that, again, is based on what we have heard before.</p>
<p>In the case of the example above, the pattern is broadly (but not universally) familiar. It’s also repetitive over a short <em>cycle</em>, a single iteration. Cycles can be measured in different ways. A composer scoring a film might be thinking in terms of seconds or milliseconds to line up the sound and the video. It is more common, though, to refer to an internal pulse called a <em>beat</em>. That word gets used in many other ways, though, and we’ll leave it for now and come back to it later.</p>
<h3 id="organizing-time">Organizing time</h3>
<p>That earlier pattern is fairly simple (which doesn’t mean that it’s not interesting or full of potential creativity). More intricate patterns with less regular internal relationships can make it harder to grasp what’s happening at first. More significantly, however, is the fact that there is no single way to hear or feel rhythm, let alone music. Here is an example from a family of common rhythmic cycles that are common in African diasporic traditions, especially in Brazil, Cuba, and the United States. It usually gets played on an instrument that is loud and clear, since musicians use the pattern to hold everything else together. A bell of some sort or the <em>clave</em>, a pair of sticks, are common instruments to use. This particular variation is sometimes called the <em>rumba clave</em> after the Cuban rumba (see Moore 2010).</p>

<p>Go back and listen to that again, but try and clap along this time. Just see if you can work it out. It might be hard, it might be easy. Where does the cycle start? Can you hear the point where it repeats?</p>
<p><em>Really, listen again and try clapping or tapping along. Then try to stomp or say “Top” at the beginning of each cycle. Once you do, or you find yourself sufficiently lost, click the button below to show the next paragraphs.</em></p>

<p>Here is an example of this pattern in practice, though it is it hidden somewhat within the guitar accompaniment. See if you can hear it: <a href="https://folkways.si.edu/lydia-mendoza/la-bamba-rumba/latin-world/music/track/smithsonian">Lydia Mendoza, “La Bamba”</a>.</p>
<p>You might have heard the pattern differently, though. If we move the starting point to another part of the pattern, it changes the character.</p>
<div id="example4" class="example">

<p>Wayne Marshall describes how this pattern is tied to the racialized history of country music, calling it the “American clavé” (Marshall 2020). Flipping it so that the new beginning of the cycle is at the beginning of the graphic makes it easier to see.</p>
<div id="example5" class="example">

</div>
<p>Note that the clap to start the pattern happens during a silence. Rhythm is not just about sound, it’s about the creative use of space, too. On the <a href="http://wayneandwax.com/?page_id=9315&amp;fbclid=IwAR02xUOhjtC4fw-E6LOTQzcakI4o2IgKlkHmodg5FAbcr3X7qLmz-wS9FXk">website accompanying the article</a>, Marshall shares a long “megamix” of songs from across American music history that utilize the same rhythmic cycle. Listen for how the pattern organizes time through repetition and expectation across these songs. It might quickly become familiar. (It’s a long mix, jump around to hear different examples.)</p>

<h2 id="ambiguous-terms">Ambiguous terms</h2>
<p>It’s worth discussing the words <em>rhythm</em> and <em>beat</em> themselves before trying to use them to talk about other things. People use these words interchangeably and, in fact, they can mean the same thing. They also might refer to different, but related, ideas. I separate them here while recognizing that the language used to talk about these distinctions “in real life” is at least somewhat artificial.</p>
<p>A <em>rhythm</em> refers to sounds and silences that are associated based on their relationship in time. They come together to create a unified “thing” that might appear again. Some traditions have well-recognized names for certain rhythms. When rhythms that are familiar appear in different contexts, they might gain referential meanings over time. “Shave and a haircut, two bits” has become a common ending to songs during over the last century in America. It was so common that it could be and satirized. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4W3cPSntmBk">This short video</a> has some good examples and discusses how such a short phrase can build so much anticipation.</p>
<p>The <em>dembow</em> rhythm comes from a specific place and has its own history in the Caribbean (Marshall 2008). Like the examples above, it demonstrates how repeating a <em>rhythm</em> can turn it into a <em>groove</em>, to use a not-so-technical term. This pattern underlines global popular music styles, especially in genres like <em>reggaeton</em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="https://youtu.be/bZMPz5lzb2U">“Don Don,” a 2020 release from Daddy Yankee, Anuel AA, and Kendo Kaponi</a>, is one of many examples.</p>
<div id="example6" class="example">

</div>
<p>One use of the phrase <em>the beat</em> refers to the cycles of looping rhythmic phrases that gives forward momentum to a piece of music. As the next part describes, the <em>beat</em> of a song can also refer to a steady pulse that we sense in our bodies. The confluence of the pulse and the music that marks that pulse creates a terminological ambiguity that can be confusing when writing about sound.</p>
<p>Familiarity, expectation, and ambiguity are more than esoteric musical ideas. Musicians use them in meaningful ways. Take an example from electronic music (among other things): the beat drop.</p>
<p>When “the beat drops” in a song, the entire groove of the music dramatically and powerfully changes. That the change happens at a specific moment (<em>a beat</em>) and is caused by changes to the repetition of rhythms (<em>the beat</em>) is not lost on dancers in a club who are anticipating the drop, ready for the boost of energy. Anticipation, which is related to expectation, builds as the musician (a DJ in this case) toys with the sound of the music. The pacing of the music doesn’t change, but something in <em>the beat</em> does. It’s easier to hear this than to read about it. It’s even better to feel it happen, since rhythm and music are things that our body reacts to. Let yourself <em>feel</em> these sounds as much as you <em>hear</em> them or <em>see</em> people reacting: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nx8bGoNkvSI">Skrillex in Argentina</a>.</p>
